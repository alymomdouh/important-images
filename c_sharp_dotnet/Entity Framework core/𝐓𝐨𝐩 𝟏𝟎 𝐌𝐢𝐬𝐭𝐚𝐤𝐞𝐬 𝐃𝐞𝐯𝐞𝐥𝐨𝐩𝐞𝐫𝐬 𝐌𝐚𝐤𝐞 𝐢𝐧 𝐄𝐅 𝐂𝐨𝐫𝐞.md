Not all Senior Devs know avoid them.

Here is a list of mistakes and how to avoid them 👇 

𝟏. 𝐍𝐨𝐭 𝐔𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐈𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐱𝐞𝐬

Solution: Create DB Indexes on frequently filtered columns, to improve read queries

𝟐. 𝐍𝐨𝐭 𝐔𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬

Solution: Retrieve only the necessary fields rather than the entire entity using Projection with a Select method in LINQ

𝟑. 𝐎𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐟𝐞𝐭𝐜𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚

Solution: Use paging to select a fixed number of records, preventing from loading too many records into memory at once

𝟒. 𝐍𝐨𝐭 𝐮𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐀𝐬𝐍𝐨𝐓𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐤𝐢𝐧𝐠
Problem: By default, EF Core tracks entities to detect changes. For read-only operations, this tracking is unnecessary and adds performance overhead.

Solution: You can use AsNoTracking method to disable change tracking for the query

𝟓. 𝐔𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐄𝐚𝐠𝐞𝐫 𝐋𝐨𝐚𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐔𝐧𝐖𝐢𝐬𝐞𝐥𝐲
Problem: Fetching related data when using Eager Loading can lead to performance issues if not used carefully.

Solution: You can use filters in Include and ThenInclude methods to limit data that is loaded together with the main entity (if possible)

𝟔. 𝐈𝐠𝐧𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐓𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐬𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬 𝐖𝐡𝐞𝐧 𝐔𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐁𝐚𝐭𝐜𝐡 𝐎𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬
Problem: When using ExecuteUpdate and ExecuteDelete Batch operations - they are not tracked in EF Core. So when a SaveChanges method fails - it won't rollback your batch operations.

Solution: Manually create a transaction and commit or rollback

𝟕. 𝐈𝐠𝐧𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐜𝐮𝐫𝐫𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐲 𝐇𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐠
Problem: Multiple users can update data at the same time replacing each other's changes.

Solution: Add concurrency token and handle DbUpdateConcurrencyException in your code.

𝟖. 𝐍𝐨𝐭 𝐔𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐌𝐢𝐠𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬
Problem: Manually modifying the database schema without using EF Core migrations, causing discrepancies between the model and the database.

Solution: Use EF Core migrations to manage schema changes

𝟗. 𝐅𝐨𝐫𝐠𝐞𝐭𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐭𝐨 𝐃𝐢𝐬𝐩𝐨𝐬𝐞 𝐌𝐚𝐧𝐮𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐲 𝐂𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐝 𝐃𝐛𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐱𝐭
Problem: When using DbContextFactory, a DbContext is not being disposed leading to memory leaks

Solution: Correctly wrap your manual DbContext creation in a using statement for proper disposal

𝟏𝟎. 𝐍𝐨𝐭 𝐔𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐀𝐬𝐲𝐧𝐜𝐡𝐫𝐨𝐧𝐨𝐮𝐬 𝐌𝐞𝐭𝐡𝐨𝐝𝐬
Problem: Using synchronous methods for database operations, which can block threads and degrade application responsiveness

Solution: Async methods make your application to handle more concurrent operations
