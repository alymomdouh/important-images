𝗘𝗙 𝗖𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗰𝗲𝗽𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘀 – 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘀𝗵𝗼𝘂𝗹𝗱 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄 
 
EF Core is my favorite ORM for .NET applications. Yet, its many fantastic features sometimes go unnoticed. For example, query splitting, query filters, and 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗰𝗲𝗽𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘀. 
 
EF interceptors are interesting because you can do powerful things with them. For example, you can hook into materialization, handle optimistic concurrency errors, or add query hints. 
 
The most practical use case is adding behavior when saving changes to the database. You can do that by implementing a SaveChangesInterceptor. 
 
I've used EF interceptors for: 
 
- Audit logging 
- Soft deleting entities 
- Publishing domain events 
- Persisting Outbox messages 
 
I'm sure you can come up with a few more creative use cases for interceptors. 
 
Did you have a chance to work with EF interceptors?
