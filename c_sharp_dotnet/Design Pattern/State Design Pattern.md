## Meta Description: 
Learn how to implement the State Design Pattern in C# with a step-by-step guide and detailed example. 

This article explains how to manage an object's behavior based on its state, encapsulating state-specific logic for maintainable and clean code.

## Introduction
The State Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. It’s a way of implementing state machines and helps keep code organized by encapsulating state-specific behaviors in separate classes.

This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where an object’s behavior depends on its current state, such as a vending machine, a traffic light, or a light switch.

## Why Use the State Design Pattern?
Typically, an object’s behavior depends on its fields or properties. However, with the State Pattern, we control behavior through explicit states and transitions:

## State Machines: 

State design is often used to implement finite state machines, where an object transitions from one state to another in response to events.
Encapsulation of State-Specific Behaviors: Each state has its own class, allowing us to encapsulate different behaviors in each state. This approach keeps each state’s logic organized and avoids a single, complex if-else or switch block.
## Example Scenario: Light Switch
Let’s use a Light Switch with two states: On and Off.

 We’ll define two states (OnState and OffState) and manage the switch’s behavior based on its state.

## Implementation
Step 1: Define an Abstract State Class
The LightState class is an abstract class with a method Toggle. This method will be implemented differently in each state, either switching the light on or off.
```
public abstract class LightState
{
    public abstract void Toggle(LightSwitch lightSwitch);
}
```
Step 2: Define Concrete States
We’ll create two classes, OnState and OffState, each representing a specific state of the light switch.
