## [HTTP response status codes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status)
Understanding HTTP status codes isn’t just important for developers—these codes are crucial for IT managers,

network engineers, product managers, cloud architects, and anyone involved in building, managing, or maintaining web-based applications and services. 

Let’s break it down by category:

𝟭𝘅𝘅 - 𝗜𝗻𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹 (𝟭𝟬𝟬–𝟭𝟵𝟵) 
These codes let you know that the request was received and the server is still processing. 
- 100 Continue: The server has received the request headers, and the client can continue to send the request body. 
- 101 Switching Protocols: The server is switching to a different protocol, as requested by the client.

---

𝟮𝘅𝘅 - 𝗦𝘂𝗰𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀 (𝟮𝟬𝟬–𝟮𝟵𝟵) 
The best-case scenario! The request was successfully received, understood, and processed. 
- 200 OK: The standard for a successful request—everything worked as expected. 
- 201 Created: A new resource has been successfully created, such as after a POST request. 
- 202 Accepted: The request has been accepted for processing, but it may not have been completed yet. 

---

𝟯𝘅𝘅 - 𝗥𝗲𝗱𝗶𝗿𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 (𝟯𝟬𝟬–𝟯𝟵𝟵) 
Further action is required to complete the request, usually involving redirection. 
- 301 Moved Permanently: The requested resource has been moved to a new URL. 
- 307 Temporary Redirect: The resource is temporarily available at a different location, but future requests should still use the original URL. 
- 308 Permanent Redirect: Similar to 301, but with a guarantee that the method and the body won’t change.

---

𝟰𝘅𝘅 - 𝗖𝗹𝗶𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗘𝗿𝗿𝗼𝗿𝘀 (𝟰𝟬𝟬–𝟰𝟵𝟵) 
These errors occur when the problem is likely on the client’s side, such as incorrect requests or lack of access. 
- 400 Bad Request: The server couldn’t understand the request due to invalid syntax. 
- 401 Unauthorized: Authentication is required to access the resource (or the credentials provided were invalid). 
- 403 Forbidden: The client is authenticated, but doesn’t have permission to access the requested resource. 
- 404 Not Found: The server couldn’t find the requested resource (a common error when URLs are broken or outdated). 
- 409 Conflict: The request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current state of the resource.

---

𝟱𝘅𝘅 - 𝗦𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗲𝗿 𝗘𝗿𝗿𝗼𝗿𝘀 (𝟱𝟬𝟬–𝟱𝟵𝟵) 
These indicate issues on the server’s side, often related to overloads or misconfigurations. 
- 500 Internal Server Error: A generic error message indicating something has gone wrong on the server, but the exact issue is unclear. 
- 503 Service Unavailable: The server is temporarily unable to handle the request (often due to overload or maintenance). 
- 504 Gateway Timeout: One server didn’t receive a timely response from another server, usually in a gateway or proxy context.

With the rise of microservices and distributed architectures, how have you adapted your error-handling strategies to manage 5xx server errors more efficiently?
