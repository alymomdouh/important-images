Fast. Simple. In your control.

If database performance and control matter in .NET applications, Dapper is often the first tool that comes to mind.

📌 What is Dapper?

Dapper is an open-source micro-ORM for .NET, created by the team behind Stack Overflow. It focuses on one thing only: mapping query results to objects — nothing more, nothing less.

You write the SQL. 
Dapper handles the mapping. 
No heavy abstractions in between.

📌 Why use Dapper?

✅ Blazing fast
Dapper is extremely lightweight and consistently ranks among the fastest data-access options in .NET.

✅ Full SQL control
Perfect when queries matter — complex joins, tuned SQL, or database-specific features.

✅ Simple and predictable
No magic. What you write is exactly what runs.

✅ Works everywhere
SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite — Dapper plays nicely with all of them.

📌 A few features worth highlighting:

🔸 Async support for non-blocking database calls
🔸 Parameterized queries to protect against SQL injection
🔸 Multi-mapping for handling joined results cleanly

Dapper shines when performance, clarity, and control are more important than heavy abstractions.
