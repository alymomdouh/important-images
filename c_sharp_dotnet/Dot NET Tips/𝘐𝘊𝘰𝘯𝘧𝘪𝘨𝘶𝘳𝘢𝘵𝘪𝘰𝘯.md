We have 𝘐𝘊𝘰𝘯𝘧𝘪𝘨𝘶𝘳𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯 to retrieve data from json, but it is not strongly typed. 

And there come 𝐈𝐎𝐩𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬 instances to help us with other benefits.

Now, let's simplify these Options. 

𝐎𝐩𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬 𝐩𝐚𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐧 gives our classes or settings strongly typed configuration and with enough features. 

It helps to encapsulate our settings. 

Let's look into these patterns 


𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐈𝐎𝐩𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬<> 𝐩𝐚𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐧:
It is registered as singleton and it retrieves data after the application has compiled and save to memory. 

It does not read updated settings at runtime.

Don't be shocked at debugging when you try to read an updated setting and you still not getting the current value/values. 

Use it when the setting does not change at runtime. 


𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐈𝐎𝐩𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬𝐒𝐧𝐚𝐩𝐬𝐡𝐨𝐭<> 𝐩𝐚𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐧: 
It is registered as scooped and can only be used in scooped or transient services.

It can retrieve updated data for each request which makes it a good choice when you need to read updated values at runtime.


𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐈𝐎𝐩𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬𝐌𝐨𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐨𝐫<> 𝐩𝐚𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐧:
It's registered as singleton. It retrieves data in anytime at runtime and save to memory.

IOptions<>: It reads data after the application has compiled(not for updated data).
IOptionsSnapshot<>: It can read data at anytime.
