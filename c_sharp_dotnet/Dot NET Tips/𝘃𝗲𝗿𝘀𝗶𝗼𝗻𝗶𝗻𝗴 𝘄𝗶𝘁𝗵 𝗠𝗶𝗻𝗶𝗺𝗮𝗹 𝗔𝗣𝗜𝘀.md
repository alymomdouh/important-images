## Have you tried 𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗠𝗶𝗻𝗶𝗺𝗮𝗹 𝗔𝗣𝗜𝘀?

Similar to traditional controllers, we can utilize AddApiVersioning.

𝗔𝗱𝗱𝗔𝗽𝗶𝗩𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 is used to specify the allowed versioning type, set a default version, or determine how unspecified versions should be handled.

We can create an 𝗔𝗽𝗶𝗩𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗦𝗲𝘁 to define the available versions for use.

Additionally, we can configure common options, such as whether to report API versions.

After defining the version set, we can use 𝗪𝗶𝘁𝗵𝗔𝗽𝗶𝗩𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗦𝗲𝘁 to pass it for each endpoint or group.

Then, we can map endpoints to a specific version using 𝗠𝗮𝗽𝗧𝗼𝗔𝗽𝗶𝗩𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻 or make them version-agnostic using 𝗜𝘀𝗔𝗽𝗶𝗩𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗡𝗲𝘂𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗹.
