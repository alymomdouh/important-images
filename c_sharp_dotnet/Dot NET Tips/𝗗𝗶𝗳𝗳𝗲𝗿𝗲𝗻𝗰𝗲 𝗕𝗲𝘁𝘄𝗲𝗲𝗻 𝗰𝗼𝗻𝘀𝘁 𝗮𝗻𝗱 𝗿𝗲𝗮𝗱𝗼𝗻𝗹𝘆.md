Both const and readonly are used to protect values from being changed.
But they solve slightly different problems, and choosing the right one matters.

🔹 const

🔸Value is fixed at compile time
🔸Must be assigned immediately
🔸Implicitly static
🔸Limited to simple types (int, bool, string, etc.)

🔥 Best for true constants that will never change.

🔹 readonly

🔸Value is set at runtime
🔸Can be assigned in the constructor
🔸Can be instance-level or static
🔸Works with any type, including reference types

🔥 Best when the value depends on runtime data but should remain immutable afterward.

✅ Use 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘀𝘁 when the value is universal and permanent
✅ Use 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗱𝗼𝗻𝗹𝘆 when the value is fixed per instance or decided at runtime
