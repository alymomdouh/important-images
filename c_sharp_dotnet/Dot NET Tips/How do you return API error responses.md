## How do you return API error responses?

Here's how I do it for my .NET APIs.

Problem Details in ASP .NET Core offers a standardized solution to this challenge.

Problem Details is a machine-readable format for specifying errors in HTTP API responses.

HTTP status codes don't always contain enough details about errors to be helpful. 

The Problem Details specification defines a JSON document format to describe problems.

It's explained in detail in RFC 9457 (the old RFC 7807 is now obsolete).
