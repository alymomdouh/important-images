💡 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐓𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐬𝐟𝐞𝐫 𝐎𝐛𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐬 (𝐃𝐓𝐎𝐬), encapsulate data that needs to be transferred across various layers or components of an application. 

⚡ 𝐑𝐞𝐜𝐨𝐫𝐝 types are introduced in C# 9.0 and .NET 5 that allows you to create simple, immutable data types.

🔥 They are particularly useful for representing 𝗗𝗧𝗢𝘀 (Data Transfer Objects) because they provide a concise syntax for defining classes that are primarily used to transfer data between layers of an application,

such as between the business logic layer and the presentation layer.

🔸 Easy to maintainable code.

🔸 Concise syntax.

🔸 Simplicity.

🔸 Clean and immutable code.

### 💥 𝐑𝐞𝐜𝐨𝐫𝐝𝐬 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐃𝐓𝐎𝐬
 
 ✅ 𝐑𝐞𝐜𝐨𝐫𝐝 instead of 𝐜𝐥𝐚𝐬𝐬 for our 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐓𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐬𝐟𝐞𝐫 𝐎𝐛𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐬 (𝐃𝐓𝐎𝐬). 📊
 
 🎯 Why 𝐑𝐞𝐜𝐨𝐫𝐝𝐬?
 
 ➡ 𝐈𝐦𝐦𝐮𝐭𝐚𝐛𝐥𝐞 by Default: 
 
 Records are immutable by design, meaning once created, their state cannot be modified. This helps ensure data consistency and reduces the risk of unintentional bugs.
 
 ➡ 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐜𝐢𝐬𝐞𝐧𝐞𝐬𝐬: 
 
 Records allow us to declare a class with a concise syntax. Getters, setters, and equality members are automatically generated, reducing boilerplate code and improving readability.
 
 ➡ 𝐕𝐚𝐥𝐮𝐞 𝐒𝐞𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐜𝐬: With records, 
 
 equality is based on the values of the properties, promoting a value semantics approach. This aligns perfectly with the purpose of DTOs, which often carry data without behavior.
 
 ➡ 𝐏𝐚𝐭𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐧 𝐌𝐚𝐭𝐜𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐠: 
 
 Leverage the power of pattern matching with records. This enhances our ability to work with DTOs in switch statements, making code more expressive and elegant.
