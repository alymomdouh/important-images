What is Structured Logging? ⬇ 


Traditional plain-text logs can be hard to read and analyze. 


Structured logging aims to improve this by logging events that are structured as key-value pairs. 


This provides a standard, predictable format that's easier to query and analyze. In most cases, JSON is used.


Serilog is a popular structured logging library for .NET applications. 


It's easy to set up, feature-rich, and supports a wide variety of "sinks" - outputs where your logs can be sent.
