𝗘𝗙 𝗖𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗰𝗲𝗽𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘀 – 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘀𝗵𝗼𝘂𝗹𝗱 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄 
 
EF Core is my favorite ORM for .NET applications. Yet, its many fantastic features sometimes go unnoticed. For example, query splitting, query filters, and 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗰𝗲𝗽𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘀. 
 
EF interceptors are interesting because you can do powerful things with them. For example, you can hook into materialization, handle optimistic concurrency errors, or add query hints. 
 
The most practical use case is adding behavior when saving changes to the database. You can do that by implementing a SaveChangesInterceptor. 
 
I've used EF interceptors for: 
 
- Audit logging 
- Soft deleting entities 
- Publishing domain events 
- Persisting Outbox messages 
 
I'm sure you can come up with a few more creative use cases for interceptors. 
 
Did you have a chance to work with EF interceptors?

🔸 .𝗡𝗘𝗧 𝟲 / 𝗘𝗙 𝗖𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝟲 𝗕𝘂𝗹𝗸 𝗨𝗽𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗲𝘀:
In .NET 6, performing bulk updates required fetching the data, modifying it in memory, and then saving the changes.
While functional, this method involves retrieving entities from the database and iterating over them, which can be inefficient for large datasets.

🔹 .𝐍𝐄𝐓 𝟖 / 𝐄𝐅 𝐂𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝟖 𝐁𝐮𝐥𝐤 𝐔𝐩𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐬:
In .NET 8, the new ExecuteUpdateAsync method allows bulk updates directly on the database without retrieving entities, greatly boosting performance.
This method reduces the overhead of loading and tracking entities, making bulk operations faster and more efficient.

With EF Core 8, bulk updates are not only simpler but also significantly more performant, revolutionizing the way we manage large datasets in modern applications. 🚀

Parallel

💡 In .NET Core, the Parallel class, part of the System.Threading.Tasks namespace, provides functionality for parallel programming, allowing multiple tasks to run concurrently. 
Let's discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using the Parallel class, followed by a sample code snippet.

✔ Advantages:

Improved Performance: By utilizing multiple cores of the processor, the Parallel class can significantly improve performance for computationally intensive operations.

Simplicity: The Parallel class provides easy-to-use methods such as Parallel.For and Parallel.ForEach that abstract away much of the complexity associated with task creation and management.

Automatic Load Balancing: The Parallel class handles load balancing automatically, distributing iterations across available threads effectively.

Cancellation Support: It supports cancellation of parallel operations through the use of CancellationToken.

Exception Handling: The Parallel class provides mechanisms to handle exceptions that may occur during the execution of parallel operations.

❌ Disadvantages:

Overhead: For small tasks, the overhead of creating and managing multiple threads can lead to worse performance compared to a single-threaded approach.

Shared State Issues: When multiple threads access shared resources or state, it can lead to data races, requiring careful synchronization.

Debugging Difficulty: Multithreaded applications can be harder to debug and maintain due to race conditions and deadlocks.

Not Suitable for All Scenarios: Parallel programming may not be beneficial for I/O-bound operations where tasks are waiting for external resources such as files or network responses.

Dynamic Workload Challenges: It may not effectively handle dynamically changing workloads or workloads that are dependent on each other.

🔎 Explanation:

List<int> numbers: This creates a list of numbers from 0 to 99,999.

Parallel.ForEach: This method processes each element in the list in parallel. Each iteration is independent, making it ideal for parallel execution.

CalculateSquare: This is a placeholder method simulating a time-consuming operation.

🔦 The Parallel class in .NET Core is a powerful tool for improving performance via parallel processing. However, it is essential to understand its advantages and disadvantages to use it correctly and effectively in the appropriate scenarios. Always consider factors like task size, shared state, and the nature of the workload when deciding to use parallelism.

TaskFactory<TResult> 

💡 In .NET, the TaskFactory<TResult> class provides methods for creating and scheduling tasks. This can help encapsulate the task creation process and offers more customization options. However, like any class, it has its advantages and disadvantages.

✔ Advantages:

Simplicity: It abstracts away some of the complexity involved in creating and starting tasks.

Convenience: You can easily create tasks that return results. Using Task.Factory.StartNew enables you to specify options, such as task scheduler and task creation options.

Custom Task Scheduling: You can specify a scheduler when creating tasks, allowing you to control on which thread the task runs.

Support for Continuations: You can create tasks that can easily be continued using methods such as ContinueWith.

Compatibility: It works well with async programming models, allowing for a more seamless integration in asynchronous programming.

❌ Disadvantages:

Complexity Overhead: For simple tasks, the additional abstraction may add unnecessary complexity. In many scenarios, directly using Task.Run might be more straightforward.

Overhead on Customization: You may not require the high level of customization that TaskFactory provides. Over-customizing can lead to bugs or improper use unless you fully understand the options being set.

Thread-pool Exhaustion: If not managed correctly, creating too many tasks may lead to thread-pool exhaustion, particularly if they are entered into blocking operations.

Backwards Compatibility: Code based on TaskFactory may need adjustments to function well in newer async workflows, especially as the language and framework evolve with newer features.

🔎 Key Points in the Sample Code:

TaskFactory<int> creates tasks that will return an int.

The StartNew method is used to create and start the task immediately. Within this task, we simulate work by delaying for 2 seconds.

task.Result allows us to retrieve the result of the completed task. Note that blocking on task completion should generally be avoided in real-world asynchronous applications, so use it with caution.

🔦 while TaskFactory<TResult> can be advantageous for tasks that need to be created and scheduled with specific parameters, it may be more complex than necessary for straightforward scenarios. Depending on your use case, you may find Task.Run or other task-related constructs in C# to be simpler and more effective.

Implementing 𝘀𝗼𝗳𝘁 𝗱𝗲𝗹𝗲𝘁𝗲𝘀 𝘂𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗘𝗙 𝗖𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗰𝗲𝗽𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘀 is easy.

Unlike hard deletes, soft deletes involve marking records as deleted without physically removing them from the database.

This method enables easy data recovery and preserves historical records.

I prefer using interceptors to implement this functionality in EF Core.

By using an interface, I can mark which entities are soft-deletable.

By utilizing a 𝗦𝗮𝘃𝗲𝗖𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗴𝗲𝘀𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗰𝗲𝗽𝘁𝗼𝗿, you can modify the entity saving process to automatically set the IsDeleted flag for deleted entities.

Additionally, using a 𝗴𝗹𝗼𝗯𝗮𝗹 𝗾𝘂𝗲𝗿𝘆 𝗳𝗶𝗹𝘁𝗲𝗿 ensures that soft-deleted records are automatically excluded from query results.

In my opinion, I have found this approach to be the cleanest.

Which approach do you use?

𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗰𝗲𝗽𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘀 are a perfect fit for auditing, logging, and caching.

They are registered per DbContext instance during configuration.

Each interceptor must implement at least one interface derived from 𝗜𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗰𝗲𝗽𝘁𝗼𝗿.

EF Core offers various types of interceptors, I primarily used 𝗦𝗮𝘃𝗲𝗖𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗴𝗲𝘀𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗰𝗲𝗽𝘁𝗼𝗿.

###  𝐄𝐧𝐮𝐦𝐬 𝐚𝐬 𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐬

By storing enums as strings, you gain readability and maintainability on your database side.
It is indeed easier to work with the Enums on the side of the program code and has its performance advantages, But using the name of Enums increases the readability of the data and this can help us in maintaining the system.

With the EF Core 𝘏𝘢𝘴𝘊𝘰𝘯𝘷𝘦𝘳𝘴𝘪𝘰𝘯 method, this change is easy to implement and requires minimal additional code.
