𝗘𝗙 𝗖𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗰𝗲𝗽𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘀 – 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘀𝗵𝗼𝘂𝗹𝗱 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄 
 
EF Core is my favorite ORM for .NET applications. Yet, its many fantastic features sometimes go unnoticed. For example, query splitting, query filters, and 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗰𝗲𝗽𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘀. 
 
EF interceptors are interesting because you can do powerful things with them. For example, you can hook into materialization, handle optimistic concurrency errors, or add query hints. 
 
The most practical use case is adding behavior when saving changes to the database. You can do that by implementing a SaveChangesInterceptor. 
 
I've used EF interceptors for: 
 
- Audit logging 
- Soft deleting entities 
- Publishing domain events 
- Persisting Outbox messages 
 
I'm sure you can come up with a few more creative use cases for interceptors. 
 
Did you have a chance to work with EF interceptors?

🔸 .𝗡𝗘𝗧 𝟲 / 𝗘𝗙 𝗖𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝟲 𝗕𝘂𝗹𝗸 𝗨𝗽𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗲𝘀:
In .NET 6, performing bulk updates required fetching the data, modifying it in memory, and then saving the changes.
While functional, this method involves retrieving entities from the database and iterating over them, which can be inefficient for large datasets.

🔹 .𝐍𝐄𝐓 𝟖 / 𝐄𝐅 𝐂𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝟖 𝐁𝐮𝐥𝐤 𝐔𝐩𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐬:
In .NET 8, the new ExecuteUpdateAsync method allows bulk updates directly on the database without retrieving entities, greatly boosting performance.
This method reduces the overhead of loading and tracking entities, making bulk operations faster and more efficient.

With EF Core 8, bulk updates are not only simpler but also significantly more performant, revolutionizing the way we manage large datasets in modern applications. 🚀

Parallel

💡 In .NET Core, the Parallel class, part of the System.Threading.Tasks namespace, provides functionality for parallel programming, allowing multiple tasks to run concurrently. 
Let's discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using the Parallel class, followed by a sample code snippet.

✔ Advantages:

Improved Performance: By utilizing multiple cores of the processor, the Parallel class can significantly improve performance for computationally intensive operations.

Simplicity: The Parallel class provides easy-to-use methods such as Parallel.For and Parallel.ForEach that abstract away much of the complexity associated with task creation and management.

Automatic Load Balancing: The Parallel class handles load balancing automatically, distributing iterations across available threads effectively.

Cancellation Support: It supports cancellation of parallel operations through the use of CancellationToken.

Exception Handling: The Parallel class provides mechanisms to handle exceptions that may occur during the execution of parallel operations.

❌ Disadvantages:

Overhead: For small tasks, the overhead of creating and managing multiple threads can lead to worse performance compared to a single-threaded approach.

Shared State Issues: When multiple threads access shared resources or state, it can lead to data races, requiring careful synchronization.

Debugging Difficulty: Multithreaded applications can be harder to debug and maintain due to race conditions and deadlocks.

Not Suitable for All Scenarios: Parallel programming may not be beneficial for I/O-bound operations where tasks are waiting for external resources such as files or network responses.

Dynamic Workload Challenges: It may not effectively handle dynamically changing workloads or workloads that are dependent on each other.

🔎 Explanation:

List<int> numbers: This creates a list of numbers from 0 to 99,999.

Parallel.ForEach: This method processes each element in the list in parallel. Each iteration is independent, making it ideal for parallel execution.

CalculateSquare: This is a placeholder method simulating a time-consuming operation.

🔦 The Parallel class in .NET Core is a powerful tool for improving performance via parallel processing. However, it is essential to understand its advantages and disadvantages to use it correctly and effectively in the appropriate scenarios. Always consider factors like task size, shared state, and the nature of the workload when deciding to use parallelism.
