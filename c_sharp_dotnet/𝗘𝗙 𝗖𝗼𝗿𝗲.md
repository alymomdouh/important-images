𝗘𝗙 𝗖𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗰𝗲𝗽𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘀 – 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘀𝗵𝗼𝘂𝗹𝗱 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄 
 
EF Core is my favorite ORM for .NET applications. Yet, its many fantastic features sometimes go unnoticed. For example, query splitting, query filters, and 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗰𝗲𝗽𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘀. 
 
EF interceptors are interesting because you can do powerful things with them. For example, you can hook into materialization, handle optimistic concurrency errors, or add query hints. 
 
The most practical use case is adding behavior when saving changes to the database. You can do that by implementing a SaveChangesInterceptor. 
 
I've used EF interceptors for: 
 
- Audit logging 
- Soft deleting entities 
- Publishing domain events 
- Persisting Outbox messages 
 
I'm sure you can come up with a few more creative use cases for interceptors. 
 
Did you have a chance to work with EF interceptors?

🔸 .𝗡𝗘𝗧 𝟲 / 𝗘𝗙 𝗖𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝟲 𝗕𝘂𝗹𝗸 𝗨𝗽𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗲𝘀:
In .NET 6, performing bulk updates required fetching the data, modifying it in memory, and then saving the changes.
While functional, this method involves retrieving entities from the database and iterating over them, which can be inefficient for large datasets.

🔹 .𝐍𝐄𝐓 𝟖 / 𝐄𝐅 𝐂𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝟖 𝐁𝐮𝐥𝐤 𝐔𝐩𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐬:
In .NET 8, the new ExecuteUpdateAsync method allows bulk updates directly on the database without retrieving entities, greatly boosting performance.
This method reduces the overhead of loading and tracking entities, making bulk operations faster and more efficient.

With EF Core 8, bulk updates are not only simpler but also significantly more performant, revolutionizing the way we manage large datasets in modern applications. 🚀
