Threading in .NET? 

It’s all about efficiency, Tasks vs. Threads. 

I’ve broken it down into a quick slide guide.

📄 Swipe through: 

🔄 Thread: Manual, lower-level, more control but more work. 

⚡ Task: High-level, efficient, lets .NET handle the complexity. 

⚙️ Use Case: Threads for control, Tasks for simpler async code.

Short, sharp insights for those who want to build faster, more scalable applications.

P.S. What do you prefer: fine-grained control with Threads or streamlined Tasks? Let’s discuss! 💬
