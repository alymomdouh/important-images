##  Clean Architecture
It’s the only way I build enterprise systems now.

The Problem? ❌
Most projects lack structure. Every team reinvents the wheel, and onboarding takes months because "every app is different."

The Solution? ✅
Clean Architecture.

But most people get it wrong.

It’s not about having 4 specific projects in your solution. It’s not about following a template blindly.

It is strictly about the Direction of Dependencies.
- Core (Domain/App): Defines the abstractions.
- Outer (Infra/API): Implements them.

The beauty is you can package this however you want:

• Traditional Layers
• Vertical Slices (my favorite)
• Modular Components

As long as the dependencies point inward, you win.
