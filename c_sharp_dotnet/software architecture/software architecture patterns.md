 ### Essential software architecture patterns

Essential software architecture patterns are fundamental design solutions that address common problems in software architecture. These patterns provide a structured approach to organizing code and components, ensuring scalability, maintainability, and performance. Some of the most recognized architecture patterns include:

1. Layered Pattern: This pattern organizes the system into layers, each with specific responsibilities, such as presentation, business logic, and data access. It promotes separation of concerns and makes the system easier to manage.

2. Microservices: This architecture breaks down applications into small, independent services that communicate over a network. Each service can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently, enhancing flexibility and resilience.

3. Event-Driven Architecture: In this pattern, components communicate through events, allowing for asynchronous processing and improved responsiveness. It is particularly useful in systems that require high scalability and real-time data processing.

4. Client-Server: This model separates the client (user interface) from the server (data processing and storage). It allows for centralized data management and can improve security and resource utilization.

5. Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA): SOA structures applications as a collection of services that communicate over a network. It promotes reusability and integration of different services, often leveraging web services.

6. Model-View-Controller (MVC): This pattern separates an application into three interconnected components: the model (data), the view (user interface), and the controller (business logic). It enhances modularity and facilitates easier testing and maintenance.

7. Repository Pattern: This pattern abstracts data access, allowing for a more flexible and testable architecture. It separates the logic that retrieves data from the underlying storage mechanism.

Understanding and applying these essential software architecture patterns can significantly improve the design and functionality of software systems, making them more robust and easier to evolve over time.

----------
Understanding Microservice Architecture 😊

Microservices are about building flexible, scalable systems by breaking down applications into small, independent services. 

Let’s break it down:

1. Client Request: The journey starts when the client sends a request, like fetching data or placing an order. 💻

2. API Gateway: Routes the request to the correct service, and handles traffic, security, and load balancing. 🚦

3. Identity Provider: Verifies who you are and if you have permission to access the requested service. 🔐

4. Services:
 - Catalog API: Manages product data using MongoDB. 📚
 - Basket API: Tracks your cart items, powered by Redis for speed. 🛒
 - Ordering API: Processes orders using PostgreSQL for secure storage. 📦

5. RabbitMQ: Helps these services communicate asynchronously, ensuring smooth message flow between them. 🐇📨

6. Docker: Packages services into containers, making deployment consistent across environments. 🛠️

7. GitHub: Houses the code for collaboration and version control. 💻

8. Terraform: Automates infrastructure management, making it easy to set up servers, databases, and networks. 🏗️

9. Pipelines: Automates the build, test, and deployment process for faster, reliable updates. ⚙️

Microservices ensure that each service does one thing well, making systems more flexible and scalable. If one service fails, the others keep running, and updates happen smoothly without disruption. 🚀

### YARP vs Ocelot - Which API gateway should you choose?

I decided to compare these popular API gateway libraries.

- Reverse proxying
- Load balancing
- Rate limiting
- Authentication
- Authorization
- Performance

So, which one is better - YARP or Ocelot?
