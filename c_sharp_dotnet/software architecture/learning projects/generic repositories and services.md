Are you tired of writing boilerplate code from project to project?

Here is what I use to address this issue 👇 

I have been creating .NET webapps for more than 10 years. I have created a lot of complex applications and a lot of CRUD APIs. CRUD APIs by their nature are straightforward, but in every project you need to write the same boilerplate code to create, update, delete and read entities from the database.

A few years ago, I was looking for ready free solutions that will allow me to ship CRUD APIs faster. And I couldn't find the perfect solution. So I created my own.

I created a set of libraries called Modern for fast and efficient development of CRUD APIs in .NET:

It allows creating a production ready applications with just a set of models and configuration which can be further extended. Modern tools are flexible, easily changeable and extendable.

𝐈𝐭 𝐢𝐧𝐜𝐥𝐮𝐝𝐞𝐬 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐟𝐨𝐥𝐥𝐨𝐰𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐨𝐧𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐬:
- generic repositories for SQL and NoSQL databases
- generic services with and without caching support
- generic in memory services with in-memory filtering capabilities
in-memory and redis generic caches
- generic set of CQRS queries and commands over repository (if you prefer CQRS over services)
- generic controllers for all types of services
- OData controllers for all types of services

𝐌𝐨𝐝𝐞𝐫𝐧 𝐬𝐮𝐩𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐬 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐟𝐨𝐥𝐥𝐨𝐰𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐚𝐛𝐚𝐬𝐞𝐬 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐟𝐫𝐚𝐦𝐞𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐤𝐬:
- EF Core
- Dapper
- MongoDB
- LiteDB

You can follow these few steps to create a ready-made API:

You only need to create your Database (Domain) Entities and DTO models. Modern library will create a ready-made API for it.
