Delegates serve as the foundation for callbacks in .NET. They are reference types that hold references to methods with compatible signatures. In simple terms, delegates allow us to pass methods as arguments to other methods, thereby enabling us to achieve dynamic invocation.

In .net 3.5 some new generic delegates -Func<T>, Action<T>, and Predicate<T> were introduced. Using generic delegates, it is possible to concise delegate type which means you don’t have to define the delegate statement. These delegates are the Func<T>, Action<T>, and Predicate<T> delegates and are defined in the System namespace.

1- The 𝐅𝐮𝐧𝐜 delegate takes up to 16 input parameters and returns a value.

2-The 𝐀𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 takes one or more input parameters but does not return anything.

3- The 𝐏𝐫𝐞𝐝𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐞 delegate represents a method that takes an input parameter and returns a Boolean value indicating whether the input satisfies a certain condition.
