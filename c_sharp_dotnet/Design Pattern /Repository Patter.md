Repository Pattern in C# 💡🖥️

The Repository Pattern is one of the most commonly used patterns in enterprise applications. It provides a way to abstract data access logic, making your code cleaner, more modular, and easier to maintain. 🚀

Here’s why you should consider using it:

1️⃣ Separation of Concerns: It decouples the business logic from data access, making it easier to switch databases or work with mock data during testing. 🧑‍💻

2️⃣ Testability: Because your data access is abstracted into a repository interface, you can mock the repository in unit tests. 🧪

3️⃣ Consistency: You can centralize your query logic, keeping data access consistent across the application. 📦


How does it work? ⚙️

In C#, you typically define an interface for the repository and then create a class that implements the interface. The interface defines methods for common data operations like adding, updating, deleting, and retrieving entities.

Pros and Cons ⚖️

Pros ✅

💯Simplifies unit testing with mocks.

💯Centralizes data access logic.

💯Promotes separation of concerns.

Cons ❌

👎Can add an extra layer of abstraction.

👎Requires discipline to avoid anemic repositories (too generic).
