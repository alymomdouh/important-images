### How can you generate API tests using AI?

Imagine if it were this simple:

• Send an API request request
• The AI takes care of the rest

It turns out you can do this from your favorite API client.

Postman has an integrated AI assistant called Postbot that can do many cool things.

Here's a 4-step guide to generate API tests with Postbot:

- Send a request to your API from Postman
- Open up Postbot and ask it to add tests for this request
- Voila, you've got a bunch of tests, and you can easily add more
- You can write custom prompts to customize the test cases further

Your test cases will execute the next time you send an API request.

You can check if some test has failed. This could mean you have a bug or a regression.
